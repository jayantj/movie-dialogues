Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  \"Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive.\""}], "sentiment": -0.038636364}], "target": "u1574"}, {"source": "u1568", "counts": 3, "lines": [{"themes": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "dialogues": [{"uttered": "u1568", "characterName": "JIM", "lineId": "L328331", "sentiment": 0.0, "text": "In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that..."}, {"uttered": "u1578", "characterName": "MERCER", "lineId": "L328332", "sentiment": 0.0, "text": "Yes, it was about 11 in the morning.
